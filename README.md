# Simulation Study

To run the simulation study, ensure that you are in the in the `simulations` directory and run the following in the R console.

```r
source("sim_main.R")
```

To post process the results from the analysis and create tables 1 and 3 in the paper, run the following in the R console:

```r
source("post.R")
```
# Data Analysis

To run the code which preforms the data analysis simply run in the R console.

```r
source("data_analysis.R")
